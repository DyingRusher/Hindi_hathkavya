# Hindi Hand Sign Language Detection

Approximately 6.3% of India's population experiences hearing or speaking impairments, underscoring the need for effective communication tools. Our project, "Hindi Hand Sign Language Detection," aims to bridge this gap by developing a real-time system that accurately recognizes Hindi hand signs.

## Project Overview

We collected a dataset of 12,000 images for training and used Mediapipe to extract coordinates for all 21 landmarks on the hand. A Random Forest model was trained on this dataset, achieving an impressive testing accuracy of 98.6%. This system is designed to detect and interpret Hindi hand signs, facilitating seamless communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

## Features

* Real-Time Detection: Processes live video input to identify hand signs instantaneously.

* High Accuracy: Employs robust algorithms to ensure precise recognition of hand gestures.

* User-Friendly Interface: Designed for intuitive use, making it accessible to a broad audience.
